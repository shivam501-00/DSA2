What is time complexicity ?
the rate at which time taken by proccess to run that code depending on different system configurationa and different input 

Big O(n) notation
3 rules for big O():
- always compute timecomplexicity in case of worst case scenario.
- avoid const 
- avoid lower value

What is space complexicity?
its memory space that our program takes
defination : auxilery space + input space
auxilery space : the space that we take to solve problem 
input space : sapce of input
VVIMP: Never do anything to input data

In problem we have given sorted array and have target whose first and last index needed we want to show in array, if it dosen't cotain target or array is null return {-1,-1}

Step 1: declare variable like low high and result array (initially{-1,-1}). 

Step 2: to write condition for not fount or null array. 

Step 3: to assign lIndex and rIndex for first and last occurence respectively.

Step 4: write code for firstoccurrence and lastOccurrence
        - in both code find mid and compare it with target and according to its value decide which to update to low or high for first and last respectively 
        - return result

Linked List :
- It is data structure which helps you increase the size and decrease the size of itself.
- e.g. in array we can define size while declearing array but cant add or delete element in it as size of array is already define 
In LinkedList We can add or remove element from structure
- In array element are located at contigeous location in heap memory. contigeous meaning one by one/ back to back.
In LinkedList element are stored in heap memory but not in contigeous pattern, they are saved at different memory location

- structur of LinkedList:
starting point of linked list is called head of LinkedList. There is one concept in LinkedList that storing memory location of next element in that element. 
say head is stored at M1 location in memory it will also invisibly store meomery location of next element in it. so it will be easy to access

- Where is it used?
in most common data structure stack and queue
in real life we use it in browser

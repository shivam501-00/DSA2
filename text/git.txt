1. to add git in folder : > git init 
2. to add all new/modified files on git : > git add . / git add file_name
3. to commit all added file: > git commit -m "Message you want to give for understanding what has been commited"
4. to check status: > git status
5. to upload local repo content to remote repo i.e. to upload local file to "github". for this we use push command
    push command :"git push origin main"
6. Hidden file : >ls -Hidden

To Add localy created repo in github

Step 1: add git in that loacal repo using ">git init"
Step 2: create remote repo in github where you want to shift local repo
Step 3: Copy link of github repo/remote repo from git hub and use command ">git remote add origin <-link->"
Step 4: To check if origin is set or not use ">git remote -v"
step 5: To Push these changes on github : ">git push origin <-branch name->"

NOTE: say we gonna update every thing on main branch for every update on project then for push commnad we can use "got push -u origin main", this will help us while pushing next time as we don't have to write "origin main" we can just write "git push"

 How to update branch name

 1. to update name of branch from 'master' to 'main' use command : ">git branch -M <-new name->"
 2. to check if name is updated or not use command : ">git branch"
 
 NOTE:only after knowing exact name of branch we can do 'push' in that beanch using that branch name with command ">git push origin <-branch name->"

how to update local repo from update that we made on remote repo?

To update your local repository with changes from the remote repository, you'll typically use the git pull command. Here are the general steps:

Step 1: open your local repo in terminal / oprn vs code terminal by opening that folder in which you have make changes in remote repo
Step 2: Fetch changes from remote repo - Use the 'git fetch' command to fetch the changes from the remote repository:">git fetch origin" 
This command fetches the changes from the "origin" remote repository and updates your local referedoences to remote branches.
Step 3: Merge Changes into Your Local Branch:
After fetching changes, you can merge them into your local branch using the git merge command. If you're working on the "main" branch, for example:
">git merge origin/main"
NOTE : If you're working on a different branch, replace "main" with the name of your branch.
// GIT PULL
you can combine fetch and merge into one command using git pull:
">git pull origin main"
Step 5: commit merged changes 
'> git commit -m "merging changes from remote to local"'
Step 6(If needed): 
">git push origin main"

3. ">git checkout <-branch name where we want to shift from current branch ->" : for shifting from one branch to another  
4. ">git branch -d <-name of branch we want to delete ->": delete branch

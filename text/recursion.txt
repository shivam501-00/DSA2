Recurtion : calling of function inside same function that means fuction calling itself is nothing but recursion 

if there is no condition to stop calling of these fuction i.e for recursion then function will run infinite time and we will face stack over flow error. 
Base condition- to stop stack overflow we add one condition which will eventually break loop when conditionbecomes true. That condition is called "Base condition"
